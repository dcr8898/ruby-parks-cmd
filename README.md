### A command line application for navigating park amenities

This app built as part of a three hour hackathon challenge at Devbootcamp consumes public XML data from the NYC parks service and allows a user to drill down to local park amenities based on a simple inquiry starting with their zip code.

The intention of this application was to demonstrate the ability to consume multiple XML sources and use them in a command line app.
